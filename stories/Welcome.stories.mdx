# Intro

Welcome to the Rancher Storybook. Considery this storybook a living style guide and component library where you can find existing components and how to use them.

# Where to Start

If you are not familar with Storybook it is recommended you start [ here ]( https://storybook.js.org/docs/basics/introduction/ ).
Some additional refrences that may be helpful include [Storybook Docs Recipes](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/addons/docs/docs/recipes.md), [Storybook for Vue](https://storybook.js.org/docs/guides/guide-vue/), ...

# Our System
We use a mix of CSF and MDX stories. Due to some limitations with Vue and Storybook we are not fully MDX but this will occur at some point in the future. MDX works well for static content and long form stories, Design systems is a great example. Components and stories that need dynamic data use the CSF format. If you're unsure the difference you can start [here](https://storybook.js.org/docs/formats/component-story-format/).

Anything that exists as a standalone component in the componetents folder will exist under the component library. Any compisiton of components that are tied together with css to make a page should exist under the design system.
