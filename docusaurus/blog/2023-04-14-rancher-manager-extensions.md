## Overview

One of the key features of Rancher Manager is its extensibility. With Rancher Manager extensions, users can extend the functionality of the platform to meet their specific needs.

Rancher Manager extensions are custom-built plugins that can be integrated into the Rancher Manager platform. These plugins are designed to provide additional functionality that is not available out-of-the-box. For example, an extension could be created to provide additional monitoring and logging capabilities, or to add custom security features.

Extensions are built using the Rancher CLI (Command Line Interface) and are packaged as Docker containers. Once an extension is packaged, it can be uploaded to Rancher Manager and installed with just a few clicks. Once installed, the extension will be integrated seamlessly into the Rancher Manager interface.

One of the key benefits of Rancher Manager extensions is that they can be easily customized to meet the needs of individual users or organizations. This makes Rancher Manager a flexible and adaptable tool for managing containerized applications. With the ability to add custom functionality through extensions, users can tailor the platform to their specific requirements.

In conclusion, Rancher Manager extensions are a powerful feature of the Rancher Manager platform that allow users to extend the functionality of the platform to meet their specific needs. By providing a flexible and customizable tool for managing containerized applications, Rancher Manager is an ideal solution for organizations looking to streamline their container management processes.
