## Overview

As part of our usability review, we learned that the top level context switching mechanism for our application is hidden behine a burger menu.


## User flow

In order to select an application or explore a cluster the user must first expand a hidden menu. As this is an action users perform often, offering a persistent way to change between app and cluster context will improve usability.
