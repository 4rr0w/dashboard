## Allow users to quickly change between apps and clusters

As part of our usability review, we learned from users that the top level context-switching mechanism could be more easily available. Currently, users have to expand a menu first, in order to change application or cluster context.

As this is an action users perform often, offering a persistent easy way to change between app and cluster context will improve usability.

Sounds too good to be true? Can't believe you're eyes?

Wait! There's more!!!
